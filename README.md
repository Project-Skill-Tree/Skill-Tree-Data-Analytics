# Skill-Tree Data-Analytics
Python library that streamlines the process of data analysis for Project Skill Tree.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies run the command pip install -r requirements.txt

To access the Database you must use a Database User and a Database Password, stored as enviornment variables as "STDB_USER" and "STDB_PASSWORD" respectively.

## Usage
There are two parts to the repository: 
1) The utilities package.
2) Jupyter notebooks on which the Data Analysis takes place.

The utilities package contains methods that process the data. There is a pandas DataFrame for each type of data, which can be manipulated as needed in the notebooks.

Currently the old version of the source code is still in the repository, until refactoring is completed.
